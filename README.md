<h1>SuperSpaceScavengers</h1>

<h2>Engine</h2>
<p>Unity3D</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p><em>Super Space Scavengers</em> is a 2D, top-down, tactical action game where players fight to strip an abandoned spaceship of its most valuable loot/parts before the ship becomes completely unstable and explodes.</p>

<h2>Core Features</h2>
<p><em>Super Space Scavengers</em> will focus on the following core features:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Mechanically simple with many mechanical interactions (Environment/equipment)</li>
 	<li>Fast and Frantic gameplay</li>
 	<li>Procedurally Generated Spaceships (Levels)</li>
 	<li>Progression, keeping players playing more round and on into more games</li>
 </ul> 




<h2>Theme</h2>
<p><em>Super Space Scavengers</em> takes place in a futuristic science-fiction setting. While space travel and furturistic technology exists, it is not always bright, clean, and new technology. The world is scrappy and more wild west-like, with space ships being held together with the equivilent of duct tape and a prayer. Good parts are hard to come by and maintaining what you got is the difference between death and survival.</p>
Human, robot, and alien

<h2>Genre</h2>
<p><em>Super Space Scavengers</em> is a singleplayer/multiplayer 2D, top-down, tactical action game.</p>

        <h3>Environmental Interactions</h3>
        <p>A lot of the excitement in <em>Super Space Scavengers</em> comes from just how quickly things can go wrong when systems start to fail on a damaged spaceship. The following list are planned events/interactions that can occur:</p>
        <ul>
            <li></li>
            <li></li>

    Goals
The environment should make sense for areas that are clearly defined as passable hallways and rooms. The game manager needs to understand what is happening in rooms/hallways/space at all times.
The environment needs to understand the current state of power in rooms/hallways in order for the right interactions to take place. Layout generation for ships can vary depending upon faction (organized for humans, organic for alien, etc.)

	Pre-Generated Rooms
Rooms are generated ahead of time and are connected via hallways in a way that is organized and makes sense.
	Power
Powerlines are not always exposed (items like an X-Ray machines can help you follow the trail). Power lines can be exposed naturally and even not at all. Powerlines, when powered, pulse every so often.
	Room/Hallway Types
Bridge / Command Center / Piloting section
Engine Room / Reactor (could be multiple)
Weapons Bay
Life Support Area
Doctor/Medical Area
Science Labs
Brig
Cargo Bay(s)
Docking Station
Crew Quarters
Elevators
Traversal Tubes
Mess Hall
Rec Center
Janitor’s Closet
Random Important Electrical Systems
Bathrooms
Garbage Compactor
Hanger Bay
Maintenance Tunnels
	Layout generation is the most complicated thing, and will need constant testing to find out what works and what doesn’t.
